Installation
============

You will need the library [stem](https://stem.torproject.org).
You can install the Python dependencies via pip.
`pip install -r requirements.txt'

First, get the current consensus by running:  
`$ tor -f doc/torrc.fetch`

Then, start the bare Tor process which is used by the scanner:  
`$ tor -f doc/torrc`

Finally, you can run the scanner:  
`$ python scanner.py -c /tmp/tordata/cached-consensus checktest`
